        I would ask anyone reading this to first read
        <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/~rkarthik/DAGAP.pdf">DAGAP</a>. I will only propose changes to
        parts of it if they are outdated. For some context, I have not (yet) been a part of the Admissions
        Committee at CMU, and these are my experiences from my firends' and
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/1k8midy/final_outcomes/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">
        my outcomes</a>. While DAGAP provides appropriate weights to different parts of the application
        process, I will try to provide timelines and strategies I used wherever possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that admissions into top schools are generally quite stochastic, and I would recommend
        applying to multiple programs even if you are confident about your application.

    <h3 id="gre-and-toefl" style="margin-bottom: 0px;">GRE & TOEFL</h3>
    <p>
        When I applied to universities for Fall'25, most universities did not consider the GRE or had made it
        optional. This year (for Fall'26) even
        <a href="https://ml.cmu.edu/academics/primary-ms-machine-learning-masters">CMU's MSML program has made
        it optional</a>. I personally did not send it to schools where it was optional.
    </p>
    <p>
        In my opinion, if you still have to submit it somewhere, a score of <b>320 and above is
        adequate</b>, a higher score is better, but is not a decisive factor as stated in DAGAP. The quant
        score should ideally be greater than or equal to 168. The verbal score can be compensated with an
        excellent TOEFL / IELTS score.

        <b>FACTS:</b> I had a GRE score of 323 (Q: 168, V: 155, A: 4.5), I did submit it to CMU's MSML
        program. I know a senior who had 321, and got admits from top schools like UMich and Georgia Tech.
        Thus my opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
        For TOEFL, I just have a minor addition, some shools set up a sectional minimum score as well, and
        in extreme cases, would not look at applications with less than the sectional minimum. For example,
        <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/grad/faq">Princeton requires a speaking score of at least
        28</a>, I have not seen many other schools who set up such stringent criteria.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, you should plan to give both of these at least about a month before the deadlines, to have
        results in time.
    </p>

    <h3 id="academics" style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Academics</h3>
    <p>
        I strongly agree with DAGAP, and will only add one additional statement as a strategy. I would
        advise anyone to put their primary focus on their academics, and raise their GPA from whatever it
        is. Investing time in academics is a low risk high reward strategy. Trying to compensate GPA with
        any other aspect is a high risk high reward strategy, it only works sometimes.
    </p>

    <h3 id="sop" style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Statement of Purpose</h3>
    <p>
        Again, I agree with DAGAP entirely; though due to that, I didn't pay a lot of attention to my SoP,
        and wrote it much later (only a few days before the deadline). I would advise anyone to start much
        earlier (about 2 weeks)! I am also sharing a few resources I used,
        [<a href="https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/eecs/commkit/graduate-school-statement-of-purpose/">MIT
        CommLab</a>][<a href="https://github.com/jeanqasaur/academic-application-materials/blob/master/phd-application-2007/personal_statement.pdf">example</a>].
        I would also suggest too get it reviewed by as many people as possible, especially those who have
        been through the process (MS / PhD applications). You should write it once before any review /
        examples so you're not biased towards a style or flavour.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, I shortlisted universities based only on some rankings and prestige, thus I would also go
        through the entire faculty list of the department manually and mention professors I liked and would
        want to work with, in most cases there would be muiltiple natural alignments.
    </p>

    <h3 id="lors" style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Letters of Recommendation</h3>
    <p>
        I strongly believe that after GPA, this is the field that is given the most importance, as this is
        entirely out of the applicant's control. I think DAGAP places most of its opinions correctly, I'm
        not sure about the negative points part, overly glorifying letters are definitely bad.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a strategy, reach out to professors much earlier, about 7-8 weeks before the deadlines. Most
        professors would ask some summary / bullet points of their experience with you, otherwise as well,
        it would not hurt to send such a summary along with your updated CV and transcript. Also don't shy
        away from asking to highlight specific details, like TA-ship experience, etc.
    </p>

    <h3 id="research" style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Research</h3>
    <p>
        This was probably not a major factor in decisions at the time of DAGAP I think (it is a subsection
        not a section). However, the landscape has definitely shifted over the years. Much more for AI
        related fields, but also for other subfields in CS, like networks or
        systems<span class="special-hover"><sup>1</sup><span class="tooltip">Maybe not as much for
        theory</span></span>. I think even then, the guidelines there are still correct.
    </p>
    <p>
        I think some form of research experience is now an unwritten requirement for most top schools.
        Note that I am saying research experience and <b>not</b> publications (I strongly believe
        undergraduate research is really random, but that's another story). I think so because the
        applicant pool is so strong, and the seats so few, that the committee will always have enough
        applicants <i>with</i> research experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before I get cancelled by the research community, you should <b>not</b> do research in order to get
        into a top school. What I mean is, if your primary goal with research is to get an admit, you're
        not doing it right. Your primary goal with research should be to do research. Research strategy is
        an article in itself, though I would suggest to start early, as early as possible.
    </p>

    <h3 id="research" style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Work Experience</h3>
    <p>
        The advice in DAGAP is again quite apt, as a side note, I have seen people applying usually with
        2 years of experience. I would strongly advise anyone taking this path to get into some top company
        or work in a top research lab / startup. For India, Microsoft Research and Google DeepMind have
        their own (competitive) pre-doctoral programs
        [<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/research-fellows-program-at-microsoft-research-india/">MSR</a>]
        [<a href="https://shaily99.medium.com/demystifying-the-pre-doctoral-researcher-role-at-google-research-india-c063e5c73f10">GDM</a>]
        GDM posts the opening when its open. Top IIT / IISc professors are also more than willing to host
        students for a year or so.
