    <h1>How to prepare for Machine Learning (Research) Interviews?</h1>
    <i>Last edited: 16th December 2025</i>
    <p>
        Once going through the process of applying and interviewing for a few ML research internships
        (Summer 2026), I had a better view on what / how to prepare for this, and wanted to share my
        approach. These are my personal opinions, and I will not reveal any specific questions from any
        company. Also, I think this will not be very effective for MLE roles, or any role that isn't
        substantially research oriented. This post is much longer than others.
    </p>
    <p>
        Final note, I will provide lots of resources and links. It is impossible to cover and remember
        everything even if you start early, it is important to know what stuff to prioritise according to
        the firm. To establish a bit of credibility, I received an offer from Mistral AI for an AI
        Scientist internship in their Palo Alto office.
    </p>
    <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Table of Contents</h2>
    <ul style="margin-bottom: 0%;">
        <li>
            <a href="#overview" target="_self">Overview / General advice</a>
        </li>
        <li>

            <a href="#final_rounds" target="_self">Final Rounds</a>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="overview" style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Overview / General advice</h3>
    <p>
        These interviews typically follow a structured process, with the exact details varying by company.
        Usually, there will be a a <a href="#cv" target="_self">résumé screen</a>, followed by a couple of
        <a href="#ml_rounds" target="_self">ML rounds</a> and / or
        <a href="#coding_rounds" target="_self">coding rounds</a>, and finally some
        <a href="#final_rounds" target="_self">logistics / HR rounds</a>. This process can take anywhere
        from 2 weeks to a bit over a month, depending on the company's and your availability.
        <b>Important:</b> Its quite likely that your first round will be a recruiter call, do not forget to
        get as many details about the process as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a significant time investment, and you will spend about 2-4 weeks of effort depending on
        your background and preparation level.
    </p>

    <h3 id="cv" style="margin-bottom: 0px;">CV / Résumé shortlisting</h3>
    <p>
        This is almost always the first step of the process, unless you apply with a referral.
        It is very hard to pinpoint what exactly makes a CV / Résumé standout, so I will instead describe
        what I think is important. <b>Important:</b> Some firms will outright list what they want to see,
        for those cases it is crucial to modify your document and add / remove stuff accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
        I made my document with LaTeX, and I would suggest doing this as well. I have provided a link
        to my LaTeX source
        [<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ykuqFeLraKCSauguLgcgbw_gxlKLNCNr/view?usp=sharing">link</a>].
        It is important to read lots of job descriptions and you will realize the types of skills you can
        highlight. For example, I had previously used LLMs for some data cleaning tasks, but I thought
        these skills were not relevant, so I hadn't included them, but from what I saw, a lot of companies
        would prefer to see experience with using LLMs to automate tasks. <b>Important:</b> Don't
        underestimate seemingly "minor" technical experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also one thing to keep in mind (thanks to CMU's <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/career/">CPDC</a>) is
        that each point in the document <i>must</i> have something you did and its impact, quantitative
        preferred. Otherwise it can be pruned without affecting quality. It is also nice if you have a one
        page version and just submit that, but this isn't a hard rule.
    </p>
    <p>
        Regarding the structure, I think the format and sections I have used are quite well suited. Maybe
        the only section that's missing is "Projects". In case you have a lot of publications,
        strategically highlight the relevant ones according to the firm. I think research match is quite
        important for these roles. To be clear, this can also be through coursework but applying solely
        based on interest is probably not going to work out now (again my personal opinion).
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Important:</b> Making and updating the CV / Résumé is an ongoing process, and will take
        significant time on the first go, do not rush it.
    </p>

    <h3 id="ml_rounds" style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Machine Learning Rounds</h3>
    <p>
        I think that these rounds test your competency in three areas (at the time of writing):
        <ul>
            <li>Machine Learning and Deep Learning Fundamentals</li>
            <li>LLM training and inference optimizations</li>
            <li>Your Research</li>
        </ul>
        These are quite broad areas, however, from my experience, firms will expect you to be significantly
        strong in all of them.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Important:</b> For this post, I have to advertise that this is my opinion again and again,
        because I went through resources I was familiar with. A good way to start would be to probably ask
        some LLM and get a list of resources.
    </p>
    <p>
        For ML and DL Fundamentals, I would suggest revising your notes from your courses, or going through
        cs229 [<a href="https://github.com/maxim5/cs229-2018-autumn">GitHub (unofficial)</a>] and cs231n
        [<a href="https://cs231n.stanford.edu/">Website</a>]. <b>Important:</b> Note that I had done these
        courses <i>previously</i>, if you haven't, then <b>DO NOT</b> start them from scratch. Instead pick
        up a few topics you need to revise and just go through those lectures. Finally, I revised just
        about everything from these except the last parts on RL. It takes significant effort even the
        second time, about 2-3 days of full time work.
    </p>
    <p>
        For LLM training and inference, this specific area might seem unlikely to be tested. If you know
        this to be the case for the firm, I would still suggest going through some of the videos below as
        they introduce distributed training and inference concepts in general, which is almost certainly
        going to be tested (and useful!).
    </p>
    <p>
        For this one, I went through MIT's 6.5940: TinyML and Efficient Deep Learning Computing
        [<a href="https://hanlab.mit.edu/courses/2024-fall-65940">Website</a>]. I had not done this one
        before, and so I was speedrunning lectures. I think the lectures on quantization and pruning are
        important. Then a lot of Chapter II and the entire Chapter III is very useful. My goal with this
        was not to remember every detail but to cover lots of surface area. This again depends on the firm
        and their interview style. This took less effort than the others, about 2-3 days of watching 3-4
        lectures a day. At the end, you should be familiar with basic types of parallelism for inference
        and training.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, your research. This is a part of the process which is necessary but not sufficient. You
        will definitely get rejected if you are weak on this portion. It is important to have a very strong
        grasp of one of your research projects, ideally the one that's relevant to the firm. I don't have
        specific advice here, I guess it's a good habit to make slides for your paper, just when the
        project ends, when it's fresh in your mind (I picked this up from
        <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zpNTeogAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Ashwin</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
        I also found using LLMs to be very useful for these reviews, ask them to quiz you or create several
        questions, and then also ask it to answer them.
    </p>

    <h3 id="coding_rounds" style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Coding Rounds</h3>
    <p>
        These rounds can involve both ML and the usual Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions.
        First, I'll talk about DSA stuff, because it's straightforward to prepare for.
    </p>
    <p>
        I solved the entirety of the Blind75 list
        [<a href="https://neetcode.io/practice/practice/blind75">link</a>].
        These have video solutions, though I would strongly suggest also going through the solutions in
        the editorial / discussions, and understanding <i>each one</i> of them. <b>Important:</b> I would
        suggest not spending more than 15 minutes on any problem if you are stuck (take as much time for
        the actual implementation as you need). If some concept is completely new to you, then try to watch
        some video or read up on it. These problems may appear directly, but even if they don't they form a
        nice basis for the pattern recognition required for DSA. Your goal is to kind of internalize these
        problems at least. It should not take more than 15 minutes to solve any of these problems after you
        have practiced them enough. This took me one week of full time effort, and I was familiar with most
        of these concepts from my undergrad. If you are starting out fresh, it <i>will</i> take longer.
        <b>Important:</b> This is usually the make-or-break round, so take enough time to prepare well.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you want to test further, you can try the NeetCode 150 list
        [<a href="https://neetcode.io/practice/practice/neetcode150">link</a>], or pick a few areas where
        you think you might struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
        ML Coding can be a bit tricky to prepare for, because it's quite broad. In general, you should know
        basics of modern architectures <i>thoroughly</i>, and also their APIs in one popular framework
        (e.g. PyTorch or TensorFlow). LLMs are also useful here. Ask one LLM to generate some code for a
        type of ML algorithm (say convolutions) and then ask another LLM to find bugs and optimize this
        code (vectorization, space complexity, etc.) This is extremely useful to get you thinking about the
        internals of these algorithms. For transformers, the Arena blogs have nice exercises
        [<a href="https://arena-chapter1-transformer-interp.streamlit.app/[1.1]_Transformer_from_Scratch">link</a>].
        I was quite familiar with this, and revised them with cs229 and cs231n, so it took around 2-3 days
        of effort. <b>Important:</b> I would advise against trying to implement everything from scratch.
        The goal is to refresh quickly. If you really have a lot of time, this is not a bad idea.
    </p>
    <p>
        In some cases you might even receive a take-home assignment. With or without that, a useful skill
        is to have a good grip of accepted styles and best practices for code. Like type hints, docstrings,
        etc. Also some internals of python like copy by reference or copy by value, list comprehensions,
        etc. These are small things that can help you stand out.
    </p>

    <h3 id="final_rounds" style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Final Rounds</h3>
    <p>
        Final rounds are typically HR conversations to discuss logistics, compensation, and team placement.
        It is important to understand that, you must say that the current firm is your top choice! This is
        an obvious red flag otherwise.
    </p>

    <p>
        All the best!
